                <div class="panel-body">
                    Really two reasons for putting this list together:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A co-worker mentioned that he has a friend that made the statement "No good movies were made
                            before 2000".
                            Another co-worker responded (later) with "were there any good movies made after 2000".
                            This statement bugged me for a number of days until it boiled over into me making my own
                            list.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At the end of my life, I (probably) won't have a vast fortune to bequeath to my son.
                            However, I do love (and am passionate) movies and would want my son to understand and at
                            least recognize those movies which I consider good.
                            He would probably say "buy me a hamburger and we'll call it even" but here goes...
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading"><h4>Why isn't the list ranked by favorites?</h4></div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    On the internet, there are millions of lists ranking the best movies.
                    My opinion is that, like music, people's tastes change on any number of factors: time of day, time
                    of year, seasons, political climate, technology changes, etc.
                    My feeling is that any list I created but be "stale" almost immediately.
                    My goal was to simply list the movies that I liked and expect the agreements//disagreements that
                    followed.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="panel panel-default">
                <div class="panel-heading"><h4>Criteria</h4></div>
                <div class="panel-body">
                    The movies on this list had to meet the following criteria/rationale:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            All movies must be able to be watched/re-watched an infinite amount of times without
                            loosing (significant) appreciation.
                            Obviously, you can't (really) forget plot twists and surprise endings, but movies on my list
                            can be watched over and over with little bits of nuance added each time they're watched.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Movies on this list should be independent of the year they were made. They should be
                            timeless.
                            Humor, commentary, and content should span the passage of time. Some leniency (but not much)
                            for the quality of special effects is granted.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some movies are included because they represent landmarks or game changers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
