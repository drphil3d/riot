### Goal
Create a serverless website in AWS to support IoT devices.
### Real Goal
Save money by utilizing free tier of AWS to host S3 + lambda + dynamodb + cognito based web site for my IoT devices (multiple Raspberry Pi).
That way don't have to pay for AWS EC2 instance running around the clock.
Will use some jinja based templates to generate the html static files.
